# MapReduce_example

In this example I am using spark RDD and PySpark MapReduce techniques to calculate:
1) R-square to compare between measured orbit time and expected orbit time. ()
2) Radius of most distant planet.

The file “Planets and Jupiter moons.csv” consist of 5 columns, each represent the following information (from the first column to the last,
respectively): “Mass name (that is, around which mass does the satellite orbit)”, ”Satellite name”,
”measured orbit time [in earth days]”, ”measured orbit radius [in km]”, ”expected (theorethical) orbit
time [in earth days]”.
